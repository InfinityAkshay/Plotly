```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
```

## What is this?
We shall plot all the data points of the `mtcars` dataset and fit a linear regression line to it.

- `x-axis`: Weight of the car
- `y-axis`: Miles per gallon (MPG)


## MPG vs WT Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)

# Create a scatter plot with regression line
p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

# Convert the ggplot to a plotly object
ggplotly(p)
```
